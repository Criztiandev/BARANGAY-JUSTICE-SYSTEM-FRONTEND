# Molecules

Molecules are simple combinations of atoms

Use when you need to combine 2-3 atoms that frequently appear together
Examples: search bar (input + button), form field (label + input + error message)
Guidelines:

- Should have a single, clear purpose

- Should still be relatively reusable across different contexts
- Should only contain atoms and basic logic

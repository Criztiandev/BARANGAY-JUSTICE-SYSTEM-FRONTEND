# Organisms

Organisms are complex UI sections

Use for distinct sections of your interface that combine multiple molecules
Examples: navigation bar, product card, comment section
Guidelines:

- Can contain both atoms and molecules

- Should represent a distinct section of your interface
- May have more complex logic and state management
- Should still be reusable but might be more context-specific
